# Numerical Analysis - Dr. Ahsan Habib

### Lecture-01:    29th August, 2022

sometimes exact solutions can be extracted but sometimes not.
so we need to be as precise as we can.

Hard time solution, real time solution.
how much error (threshold value) we will accept.

**Why use Numerical Methods?**
- To solve problems that cannot be solved exactly
- To solve problems that are intractable

**How do we solve an engineering problem?** <br>
Problem Description -> Mathematical Model -> Solution of Mathematical Model -> Using the Solution

Mathematical Model: Converting the problem into mathematics.otherwise computer cannot help to solve this problem.
Using the Solution: Compare with existing solutions.
